<h1>Biella</h1>
<h2>Why</h2>
<p>I live in Biella... because life brought me back here. While I have a preference for life in cities over the countryside, I find having friends around the best way to enjoy the place where you live.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The city and its neighbourhood have some interesting bits of history. Some of them more ancient, the city was born as a Roman camp, some of them more recent and linked to the textile industry.</p>
<p>Biella flourished with the textile industry. The location, at the foot of the Alps, with many streams of water converging, allowed factories to operate and threads to be washed. Starting from the end of the 19th century. Till... it was not true anymore. Globalisation and Innovation moved the cheese by the end of the 20th century.</p>

<p>That left behind a city that is a strange tension.</p>
<li>Badly positioned and connected. Miserable train links, no direct highways access, no reasons to "pass through" the territory
<li>A very old population. In the last 20 years population has decreased: low fertility and young people drifting to the rest of the planet for jobs and experiences. With pensioners almost 1-1 with workers, and average pension equal to average salary...50% of Biella's income is pensions from the government. The region is... rich.
<li>Sparks of Innovation and entrepreneurship. The city was nonetheless home to Fila, Zegna. Sella presence is strong. Initiatives attract people to the region regardless of logistics. Bolle di Malto. The 2025 adunata. The yearly museum show is unmissable (but only yearly!)
<li>Beautiful location. The mountains are always there, reminding you where the north is. Hikers and cyclist love the region.
<li>With low rents and property prices (shrinking population, remember) the place attracts a nice subset of digital nomads looking for quality of life at good prices.

<h2>What to do</h2>
<p>The local websites are terrible and advertising driven... so please, enjoy and use my list of things to do here if you ever pass by :⁠-⁠)</p>
