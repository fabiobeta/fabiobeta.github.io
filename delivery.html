<h1>Fabio's laws of Delivery</h1>

<p>Across the years, I have collected my rules of thumb on the word of delivering software projects. Some of them can be exaggerated a bit... but trust me, they mostly make sense.</p>

<h2>Rule #1 - Why are we late?</h2>
<p>The main, clear, undeniable reason a project is late is... that it started too late. You can blame the lack of initial design of an agile project, you can blame unexpected API problems, you can blame the Project Manager... but fact is, if we got started when the need of the project was clear, most of those chasms would have been bridged by now.</p>

<p>Finding the courage and trust to get the ball rolling in those last decision inches is the KEY move to discover the unknowns and start tackling them.</p>
