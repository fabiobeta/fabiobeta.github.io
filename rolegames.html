<h1>Rolegames</h1>
<h2>Adventurs & Campaigns</h2>
<p>Across the centuries, I have created many adventures that I am always happy to play again. If any of these excite you... get in touch and we can plan a game 

<H3>The Claw of Clearwater</H3>
<p>My oldest Chtulhu adventure. Great to bring new detectives into the world of the mythos. It starts with a trip to a remote New England village, and then steamrolls into mystery as the killing spree of a bear becomes the least possible explanation to the strangeness overload.</p>

<H3>The Dwarven Ring</H3>
<p>I wrote this on the excitement of the first season of The Rings of Power. I humbly said "I could do better".</p>
<p>It plays with the rules of One Ring, second edition. Set somewhere in the second age, it attacks the problem of the rings. It places a gray twist on the heroes. They start with their agenda: having stolen the knowledge to forge s magic ring... they find themselves as keepersvof a terrible secret, and then as defenders of the middle earth, with the eye looking for them.</p>
<p>Yes, I did better</p>


<h2>Other Stuff</h2>

Coming soon.
