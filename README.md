This is my Digital Garden. Not exactly a blog, more my patch of internet were I leave ideas and links.

I have a deep belief that we often overengineer things, so as lon as I can this website is goingto be minimalistic: html and css, rolled by hand. 
This forces me to re-learn a bit of the basics of web development, and I like it.

Hosting on Github Pages (https://pages.github.com/), each page loads in less than 800ms. I am happy with that!
