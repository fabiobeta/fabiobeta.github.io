<h1>What's up?</h1>
<h2>Work</h2>
<p>I am Director of Professional Services at <a href="https://agicap.com/">Agicap</a>. Our mission is bringing lifting the Treasury Management of our clients to the best experience and results. Or, in simpler terms, we aggregate and enhance financial data for businesses.</p>
<p>Dealing with the Professional Services of a SaaS business is very interesting job, that joins Commercial skills, People Management and Tech. I am loving the company and the experience.</p>
<p>Before Agicap, I have lead the Profressional Services of <a href="https://poqcommerce.com">Poq</a>, a SaaS mobile E-Commerce Platform. I loved the job and the company, and I cheer for them from the sidelines. I learned a lot in 5 years there, and I remain curious if the magic of e-commerce.</p>
<p>And, before Poq, I have lead the Professional Services in Europe for Kony, a SaaS low-code company, till its exit as <a href="https://www.temenos.com/news/2020/10/16/kony-is-now-temenos/">we got acquired by Temenos</a>.</p>
<p>Even before Kony, I own a lot of my skills to <a href="https://www.reply.com/en">Reply</a>, where I built muscles in many, many software projects.</p>
<h2>Where</h2>
<p>I am mostly in <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biella">Biella</a>, Italy. Life seems to get me to London, UK, and Austin, Texas, once in while.</p>
<h2>Fun</h2>
<p>I dig Rolegames.</p>

<h2>Views</h2>
<p>I stash away <a href="views.html">links and opinions</a>. Warning: a lot of Financial Times links.</p>

<h2>Books</h2>
<p>I am re-reading <a href="books/an-elegant-puzzle.html">An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management</a> by Will Larson.</p>
<p><a href="books/team-topologies.html">Team Topologies</a> by Skeleton.</p>
