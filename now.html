<h1>What's up?</h1>
<h2>Work</h2>
<p>I am VP of Professional Services and Partnerships at <a href="https://poqcommerce.com/">Poq</a>. Our mission is bringing App Commerce to the world. Or, in simpler terms, we make Mobile eCommerce Apps for retailers.</p>

<p>Dealing with the Professional Services of a SaaS business is very interesting job, that joins Commercial skills, People Management and Tech. I am loving the company and the experience.</p>

<p>Before Poq, I have lead the Profressional Services in Europe for Kony, a SaaS low-code company, till its exit as <a href="https://www.temenos.com/news/2020/10/16/kony-is-now-temenos/">we got acquired by Temenos</a>.</p>

<p>Even before Kony, I own a lot of my skills to <a href="https://www.reply.com/en">Reply</a>, where I built muscles in many, many software projects.</p>

<h2>Where</h2>

<p>I am mostly in <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biella">Biella</a>, Italy. I travel to London roughly monthly. Life seems to get me to Austin, Texas, once in while.</p>

<h2>Fun</h2>
<p>I dig Rolegames.</p>
  
<h2>Books</h2>
<p>I am reading <a href="books/an-elegant-puzzle.html">An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management</a> by Will Larson.</p>
