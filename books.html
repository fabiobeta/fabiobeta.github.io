<h3>Scaling the revenue engine</h3>
<p>I stumbled in this book whe I started working for <a href="http://poqcommerce.com">Poq</a>. It deals with a farly undocumented art: scaling a company and making it a mature one.</p>

<p>There is literature on growing teams, growing marketing, market fit...but this is the only one I know of that takes a complete view that covers many (not all, still) the challeges that await any startup.</p>

<p>I learned a lot from the reading, and got some good ideas that I ended up applying.  </p>
