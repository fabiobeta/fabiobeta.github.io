<h3><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Scaling-Revenue-Engine-Tom-Mohr/dp/1543948987">Scaling the revenue engine</a></h3>
<p>I stumbled in this book whe I started working for <a href="http://poqcommerce.com">Poq</a>. It deals with a farly undocumented art: scaling a company and making it a mature one.</p>

<p>There is literature on growing teams, growing marketing, market fit...but this is the only one I know of that takes a complete view that covers many (not all, still) the challeges that await any startup.</p>

<p>I learned a lot from the reading, and got some good ideas that I ended up applying. As often with American books, some of the wisdom seems trivial once you read it!</p>
