<h3><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Scaling-Revenue-Engine-Tom-Mohr/dp/1543948987">Scaling the revenue engine</a></h3>
<p>I stumbled in this book whe I started working for <a href="http://poqcommerce.com">Poq</a>. It deals with a farly undocumented art: scaling a company and making it a mature one.</p>

<p>There is literature on growing teams, growing marketing, market fit...but this is the only one I know of that takes a complete view that covers many (not all, still) the challeges that await any startup.</p>

<p>I learned a lot from the reading, and got some good ideas that I ended up applying. As often with American books, some of the wisdom seems trivial once you read it!</p>

<l>
  <li>Invest in levers. As you grow as a company, you get more clients, more project, more complexity. Your PS team will need to keep up with it. ANY investment you can make in your team is highly valuable. Write more docs, refine your onboarding procedures, feed back continously to your product team on how they can make Services life easier.
  <li>Aligning with Sales is extremely important. Break down silos. Make sure your sales team know what your team is working on, and discover how you can help Sales. PS will be talking with clients daily, your team will have more ears on the ground than any Customer Success team, and they shoulod bring back any discovery or upsell opportunity they spot.

    <li>Customer Satisfaction is ful for the engine. Get satisfied customers. We have set up a questionnaire for our clients every time we finish a project... and the input we get is pure gold.

<p>I... love this book. Will Larson is one of the few writers that can look at the discipline of leading engineering teams and give pragmatic advice. The book is full of actual numbers on sizing teams, on how to shape services and capabilities: information we lack terribly in our world of software, where every company reinvents that same weels, and knowledge moves by hiring the right person.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/">Gergely</a> does a way better job than me at reviewing the book, so you should read his <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/an-elegant-puzzle-book-review/">review</a>.
